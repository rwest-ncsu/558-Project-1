# Describe JSON data. What is it, where does it get used, and why is it a good way to store data? This should be detailed enough that someone that hasn’t seen JSON data would have a good idea what they are dealing with. You should link to references where applicable.

# Discuss the possible packages/functions that are available for reading JSON data into R. (There are three major packages for JSON data.) Choose one and explain why you’ve chosen it.
